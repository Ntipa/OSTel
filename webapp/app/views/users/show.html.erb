<<<<<<< HEAD
          <p>After you install the app on your mobile device, you can test that everything is working by calling the user code named <i>9-1-9-6</i>. In this echo test, you should hear your own voice when you speak into the phone. You should also see "ZRTP - OK" in the yellow bar near the top of the screen, letting you know that the encryption is working. Now you can place free and secure calls to your friends who also have Ostel set up. To ensure maximum security, confirm that the same 4-digit code appears on both phones.
