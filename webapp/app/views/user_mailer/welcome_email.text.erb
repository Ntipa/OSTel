Welcome to OSTel

Are you ready to start making secure phone calls? Great! First you'll need the
right app for your phone or computer. Then you'll need to sign in with your
sweet new account info. Copy and paste the following URL and enter the account
info.

User Name: <%= @user.sip_username %>
Password: ****from sign up****
Server: <%= @user.domain %>

Guardian Project welcomes you to the open secure telephony future.

Setting up OSTel

After you install the app on your mobile device, you can test that
everything is working by calling the user code named 9-1-9-6. In
this echo test, you should hear your own voice when you speak into the
phone. You should also see "ZRTP - OK" in the yellow bar near the top
of the screen, letting you know that the encryption is working. Now
you can place free and secure calls to your friends who also have
Ostel set up. To ensure maximum security, confirm that the same
4-digit code appears on both phones. 

Tell your friends to give you a free call on your own personal Batphone, <%= @user.sip_username %>>
