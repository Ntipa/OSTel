          <h1>About Ostel</h1>                    
            <p>Ostel is a tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls.
            Our goal is to promote the use of free, open protocols, standards
            and software, to power end-to-end secure voice communications on
            mobile devices, as well as with desktop computers.</p>                      
					<h2>Our Goal</h2>
					<!-- INSERT LOGO <a href="https://guardianproject.info" target="_blank"><img  src="images/guardianproject.jpg" width="65"  height="65" align="left" alt="Insert Alt" /></a> -->
          <p>All of the necessary technologies and communications standards
          exist today for voice communications that is as secure as OpenPGP
          email. Many proprietary and open source solutions exist for
          desktop and mobile devices that already implement the necessary
          bits to provide a solution many times more secure than Skype, Viber, WhatsApp
          and other popular, yet insecure, voice messaging apps
          without dependence upon one global service provider. Yet people
          who are security conscious enough to use Skype to secure their
          computer based conversations will still hold sensitive discussion
          on mobile phones. The problem is simplicity, usability and
          reliability.</p>                  
          <p>This project will provide an application for Android phones
          that will be only marginally more complex to use than dialing an
          existing phone number, while still being based entirely on open
          standards. The app itself is based on existing open source client
          code provided by the CSipSimple, pjsip and ZORG projects. We will
          coordinate with a network of audited, open service providers
          around the world who already provide free and commercial service
          to users, to ensure our users have an automated provisioning
          process to get connected.</p>                                      
          <p>OSTN will interface with a variety of projects to ensure
          compatible with new standards around peer-to-peer VOIP
          communication. We will seek interoperability from other
          competitive, proprietary solutions from private companies and
          propose our implementation become the reference design for privacy
          and security standards.</p>

          <p><a href="https://guardianproject.info/" target="_blank">The
          Guardian Project</a> is a research and development effort powered by
          technology-focused activists, concerned citizen users, and open-source
          security software hackers. We build tools based on real-world
          experience and feedback. Our process is transparent, inclusive and
          responsible.</p>					
          <p><a href="https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostel/wiki/Server_Documentation">Documentation
          and source code</a> for building your own service like ostel.co is available.
          We encourage anyone with Linux system skills to host their own backend to
become part of a global federated secure VoIP network.</p>

          <p>We are working to define a defacto standard called <a href="https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostn/wiki/Wiki">OSTN</a> by which a
          voice over internet protocol service can be considered
          end-to-end secured, with verifiable encryption, minimal logging,
          and a decentralised model of deployment and use. From this
          standard, we will work to deploy a network of compliant
          server/service instances and client software, mobile and
          desktop, that are federated, audited and interoperable.</p>
