This is a Sinatra application to manage Freeswitch and a user signup process.

DEPENDENCIES:

Ruby 1.9.x
Sinatra
Unicorn (or other Rack compatible HTTP server)
Gmail account

INSTALLATION:

1) gem install sinatra unicorn
2) edit config.ru for your load path and define the three constants for Gmail configuration in config.ru to send mail. Any gmail account will do.
3) unicorn

If you do not have Ruby 1.9, sending email with Gmail will fail because previous
versions of the Ruby standard library net/smtp classes do not support TLS, which
is required to send mail from Gmail. There are patches available  for 1.8.x but they are
not yet included in this repository.

If you do not use a Rack compatible app server, you will not be able to load the
email configuration from config.ru unless you copy it into signup.rb.
